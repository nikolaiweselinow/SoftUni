//Write a program that prints an isosceles triangle of 9 copyright symbols ©, something like this:
//   ©
//  © ©
// ©   ©
//© © © ©
//Note that the © symbol may be displayed incorrectly at the console so you may need to change the console character encoding to UTF-8 and assign a Unicode-friendly font in the console. Note also, that under old versions of Windows the © symbol may still be displayed incorrectly, regardless of how much effort you put to fix it.
